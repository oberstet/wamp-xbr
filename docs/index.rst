The XBR Protocol
================

**XBR** (Cross-Bar Resource) is a protocol for secure peer-to-peer data-trading
and service microtransactions in `Open Data Markets <https://xbr.network>`__.

XBR sits on top of `WAMP <https://wamp-proto.org>`__, an open messaging middleware
and service mesh technology, enabling secure integration, trusted sharing and
monetization of data and data-driven microservices between different parties.

The protocol is implemented in *smart contracts* written in
`Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io>`__ for the
`Ethereum blockchain <https://ethereum.org/>`__, and is
`Apache 2.0 <https://github.com/wamp-proto/wamp-xbr/blob/master/LICENSE>`__ licensed.
